# Vietnamese woman balances work and maternity to run PPE company of nearly 400 people
Switching her career to start her own textile and personal protective equipment (PPE) company, a female mechatronics engineering graduate from the Hanoi University of Science and Technology is now leading a firm of nearly 400 employees. 

Nguyen Yen, 35 years old, is the co-founder and CEO of Nam Duong Textile Garment Production Trading JSC, which is based in the Vietnamese capital.

In a recent inteview with Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper, Yen shared her thoughts on running such a business while being a mother of two children.

According to Yen, Nam Duong JSC has exported 90 percent of its products, namely face masks and PPE, to the U.S. and Europe.

In 2020, the company shipped nearly five million sets of protective gear to such big markets as the U.S., Switzerland, Germany, and Japan, Yen said.

2020 might be a year of success for Yen, but there were tough times when the woman shouldered the pressure of both her work and maternal duties.

“But in the end, I overcame all that pressure,” said Yen.

Like many Vietnamese entrepreneurs, Yen often spares her busy time for charitable and community activities.

In January, when the new COVID-19 outbreak began in northern Hai Duong Province, Yen and her business partners donated 20,000 sets of protective clothing to medical workers on the front line of the coronavirus fight and support in other forms to people in need.

“We acknowledge that we are lucky while many others are not," Yen said.

"Therefore, we decide to give the community a helping hand in this arduous journey against the pandemic.”

The woman revealed that her company’s goal is to expand its markets internationally.
